# Aeson Traversal

You shouldn't use this! Its much more up-to-date fork can be found here: https://github.com/lens/lens-aeson/

The goal of aeson-traversal is to provide traversals and prisms for
the [Aeson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) library's
Value type, while obeying the traversal/prism laws.
